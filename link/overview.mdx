Emerge Link is a hosted consent flow that handles user authentication, consent collection, and data portability compliance. Users authenticate with their data provider (Google) and grant your application access to their data.

## How Link works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Your App
    participant Emerge Link
    participant Google

    Your App->>User: Show "Connect Data" button
    User->>Emerge Link: Click signed link
    Emerge Link->>Google: OAuth redirect
    Google->>User: Authenticate & consent
    User->>Emerge Link: Grant permissions
    Emerge Link->>Your App: Redirect with status
    Emerge Link-->>Your App: Webhook: data ready
```

## Flow states

When a user completes (or exits) the consent flow, they're redirected to your `redirect_uri` with a `status` parameter:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `success` | First-time consent granted for this user |
| `reauthorized` | User re-linked an existing consent |
| `failure` | User cancelled or an error occurred |

## What users see

The consent flow presents users with:

1. **Partner context** - Your company name and logo
2. **Data explanation** - What data will be shared and why
3. **Google OAuth** - Standard Google authentication
4. **Consent confirmation** - Explicit consent checkboxes

The flow is designed for compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and Google's data portability requirements.
