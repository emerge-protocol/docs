| **Claude** | Open in Claude with page context |
| **Perplexity** | Search Perplexity with page context |
| **MCP** | Copy MCP server URL |
| **Cursor** | Copy Cursor MCP config |
| **VS Code** | Copy VS Code MCP config |

## Using the menu

### Copy as Markdown

Click **Copy** to copy the page content as formatted Markdown. Paste directly into:
- AI chat interfaces (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Your own documentation
- Issue descriptions
- Slack/Discord messages

### Open in AI tools

Click **ChatGPT** or **Claude** to open a new conversation with the page content pre-loaded. This is useful for:
- Asking follow-up questions about the page
- Generating code based on the documentation
- Getting explanations of complex concepts

### MCP configurations

Click **Cursor** or **VS Code** to copy the MCP configuration snippet for that tool. Paste into your configuration file to enable doc search.

**Cursor config:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Emerge": {
      "url": "https://docs.emergedata.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code config:**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Emerge": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://docs.emergedata.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use MCP for repeated questions">
    If you ask documentation questions regularly, set up the MCP connection once and your AI tool will always have access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Copy for complex prompts">
    For prompts that need specific documentation context, use Copy to include exact content rather than relying on AI search.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine with your code">
    Copy documentation, paste into your AI tool, then share your code. The AI has both the official docs and your implementation.
