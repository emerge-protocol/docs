## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User grants consent">
    Embed Emerge Link in your app. Users authenticate with their data provider and grant consent in a compliant flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data is exported">
    Emerge securely exports the user's data from their provider account. Use `GET /export/status/{uid}` and wait until your provider in `sources[]` has `data_ready: true`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You query the data">
    Use the Query API to retrieve search history, browsing data, YouTube history, ad interactions, and receipts.
  </Step>
</Steps>
